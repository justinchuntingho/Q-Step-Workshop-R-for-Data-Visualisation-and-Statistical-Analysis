## Loading dataset into R and basic exploration                                   ##
####################################################################################

# The following code will load a dataset into R's memory and stored an object named 'snp'.
snp <- read_csv("data/snp.csv") # Load the file 'snp.csv', put it as an object called 'snp'

# Let's conduct some basic exploration
# The 'head()' function will return the first sixth element of an object:
head(snp)

# find out the number of rows and number of columns
dim(snp) 

# structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column
str(snp) 
# summary statistics for each column
summary(snp)


# We could use functions to gain information from the vector
# For example, 'mean()' will gives us the mean, 'max()' will give us the maximun value
max(snp$likes_count_fb)
mean(snp$likes_count_fb)

# We could use 'table()' to get frequency table
table(snp$type)
prop.table(table(snp$type)) # To show in precentage instead of count.

# For more advanced usage of functions, we could use 'which.max()' 
# to identify the element that contains the maximum value
which.max(snp$likes_count_fb)

# The result is 675, meaning that the 675th post of the dataset has the most likes.
# We can then use the slicing operator ('[' and ']') to find the post:
snp[675, ]

# We can combine them into one single line:
snp[which.max(snp$likes_count_fb), ]

########## Exercise 3 ########## 
# Find out which post has most comments and shares

# Tricky Questions: Could you find out how to just extract the link?
# Tips: start with extracting all the links ('snp$post_link'),
# then use the index to select the one we want

########## Solution ########## 
# Find the post
snp[which.max(snp$likes_count_fb), ]

# Get the link directly
snp$post_link[which.max(snp$likes_count_fb)]

# We start by loading the required package.
# install.packages("ggplot2") # You only have to run it once
library(ggplot2)

# Building plots with **`ggplot2`** is typically an iterative process. 
# We start by defining the dataset we'll use:
ggplot(data = snp)

# lay out the axis(es), for example we can set up the axis for the Comments count ('comments_count_fb'):
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = comments_count_fb)) 

# and finally choose a geom
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = comments_count_fb)) +
  geom_histogram()

# We could change the binwidth by adding arguments
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = comments_count_fb)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)

# We could add a line showing the mean value by adding a geom
# First we calculate the mean values:
mean_like <- mean(snp$likes_count_fb)
mean_comment <- mean(snp$comments_count_fb)
mean_share <- mean(snp$shares_count_fb)

ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = comments_count_fb)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean_comment, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")

# We could change color by adding arguments (fill means color of the filling in ggplot2)
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = comments_count_fb, fill = "red")) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)

# How about making it transparent?
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = comments_count_fb, fill = "red")) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, alpha = 0.8)

# We can easily coloring them by group by changing "red" to type 
# (the column that contain information about post type in the snp dataframe)
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = comments_count_fb, fill = type)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, alpha = 0.8)

########## Exercise 4 ########## 
# Using the codes above, create a histogram for Likes count ('likes_count_fb')

########## Solution ########## 
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = likes_count_fb, fill = type)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, alpha = 0.8)

# We could create a bar plot:
ggplot(snp, aes(x = type)) + 
  geom_bar()

# We could also create a plot for two categorical variables
# We color the bar by the sentiment of the posts
ggplot(snp, aes(x = type, y = ..count.., fill = sentiment)) +

# We can change how these bars are placed, 
# for example 'position = "dodge"' will place them side by side

  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

# If we use 'position = "fill"', all bar will strech out to fill the whole y axis
# The y axis then become proportion

# Creating a plot for two continuous variables (comments and likes):

# There are many things you can do by adding layers into the ggplot
# You could log them.
# PS: You will see a warning message, don't worry, it is just because our data contain zeros

# To plot a time series, the first thing you have to do is to transform your data into time/date format
# There are many formats for time and date, but the simpliest way would probably be:

snp$date <- as.Date(snp$date) # Defining a new column called 'date'

# Simply plot the same scatter point, using 'date' as the x axis
ggplot(data = snp, aes(x = date, y = likes_count_fb)) +

# For some plots, it might be easier if you transform the data in advance
# We need the following functions:
# group_by() is a function to split the data into groups
# summarise() is a function to make calculation and put the result into a new variable

plot_data <- snp %>% # Take 'snp', put into a pipe
  group_by(type, date=floor_date(date, "month")) %>% # split the data by post type and by month

# Have a look at the transformed data

# "identity would overlap. You might want to make it transparent

#   summarise(###### = sum(#######))  # Change the ########### into the variable names
